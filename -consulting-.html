            <p>Doing consulting the unconventional way.</p>
            <p>Getting into college feels tougher than ever these years. With acceptance rates dropping, everyone seems to be scrambling for the secret formula.</p>
            <p>But here’s a secret that I’ll let you into – there isn’t one. No magic trick is going to guarantee you a spot.</p>
            <p>So, what can I offer you? I will tell you this… this is not your usual sales pitch. I’m here to guide you through a process and ensure that you become true to yourself. Think about a story that appeals to admissions officers because they're real, written with the kind of passion that only comes when you are in tune with yourself.</p>
            <p>I won’t promise you any results because honestly, no one can. But I can promise you this: you’ll work hard, maybe harder than you ever have to pursue your passions, and you'll come out stronger on the other side. My journey in and of itself was very unconventional, with all my essays written rawly without many revisions, yet I somehow managed to land a spot at a “T20.” I believe the key was truly knowing who I was and showcasing my values - my goal is to ensure that you can do the same.</p>
            <p>This process will hone the skills you need to excel, not just to get into college, but in whatever goal you dream of chasing.</p>
